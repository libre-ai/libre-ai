# policy-core-v2 candidate review dossier

## Status

This is a contract candidate. It is not approved, locked for release or authorized
for implementation until independent Architecture, Security and Privacy review agents accept it.
Each reviewer agent/session differs from the authoring agent/session and follows
[`../AGENT-REVIEW-PROTOCOL.md`](../AGENT-REVIEW-PROTOCOL.md).

## Candidate authorities

- `contracts/schemas/policy-definition.v2.schema.json`
- `contracts/schemas/policy-need.v2.schema.json`
- `contracts/schemas/model-snapshot.v2.schema.json`
- `contracts/schemas/policy-evaluation.v2.schema.json`
- `contracts/openapi/model-policy.v2.yaml`
- `contracts/wit/policy-core-v2/world.wit`
- `contracts/wit/policy-core-v2/SEMANTICS.md`
- `contracts/fixtures/policy-core-v2/operators.json`
- `contracts/fixtures/policy-core-v2/golden.json`

## Review claims

1. Operator/value combinations are closed and use no coercion.
2. Exact duplicates are invalid; multiple same-name facts use universal semantics
   and reduce as `failed > unknown > satisfied`.
3. Missing, stale, future-dated and type-mismatched facts cannot produce
   `satisfied`.
4. `unknown` can produce only `indeterminate` or policy-selected `ineligible`,
   never `eligible`.
5. Policy, snapshot and need tenant IDs must match before evaluation.
6. Jurisdiction is read only from its exact fact and is never inferred from
   provider/model/company origin or hosting country.
7. RFC 8785 normalization, SHA-256 domains, evaluation ID/digest and sorted
   `ruleResults` are specified byte-for-byte.
8. The WIT world imports no host capability.
9. The result is advisory eligibility evidence only. It cannot approve a policy,
   rank suppliers, buy, deploy or trigger a transaction.
10. `proposedBy` and the human `approval.approverId` are distinct; an agent cannot approve.

## Required independent checks

The Architecture review agent must:

- challenge every operator/type/cardinality branch and verdict transition;
- confirm that schema, OpenAPI, WIT and semantic profile describe one boundary;
- independently recompute at least one success digest, one order-independence pair
  and one error vector in both TypeScript and Rust;
- confirm that no Rust engine or application implementation is hidden in this
  candidate.

The Security review agent must:

- attempt tenant substitution, digest substitution, duplicate-key and duplicate-
  fact inputs;
- attempt to obtain `eligible` from absent, stale, future or wrong-typed facts;
- attempt origin/jurisdiction conflation and satisfying-occurrence cherry-picking;
- confirm bounded arrays/strings/numbers, constant non-sensitive errors and no
  network/clock/storage/randomness capability;
- confirm that no result grants authorization, purchasing power or approval.

The Privacy review agent must confirm tenant-bound minimization, sourced facts without personal fixture data, and that logs/errors expose neither fact values nor reviewer identity.

## Promotion rule

Promotion from `candidate` to `locked` requires recorded, independent agent
verdicts from Architecture, Security and Privacy, followed by the full contract,
generated-projection and cross-runtime conformance gates. A generator, evaluator,
CI job or authoring agent cannot promote this candidate automatically.
