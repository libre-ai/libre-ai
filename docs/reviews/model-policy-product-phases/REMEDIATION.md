# Model Policy product phases — review remediation

- **Rejected candidate:** `95e49839e0ec2791333998a479dca72ed201042e`
- **Source reviews:** [business](BUSINESS-REVIEW.md), [technical](TECHNICAL-REVIEW.md), [architecture](ARCHITECTURE-REVIEW.md)
- **Scope:** coordinator remediation after three independent read-only reviews

## Integrated findings

| Finding | Remediation |
| --- | --- |
| Competing product-status authority and false MP-P0 progress | Removed current phase, phase status, gate status, blockers, and the retroactive passed gate. The JSON is a `draft` planning record; `GOALS.md` and `STATUS.md` are schema-pinned as the only status authorities. Every phase has external owner/wave/work-package prerequisites. |
| Unowned shared-root and locked-specification edits | Restored root `package.json` and `docs/apps/model-policy.md`; moved checker and tests under `apps/model-policy/**` and integrated them through the app package. |
| Bare-path evidence and unrelated-file acceptance | Added `evidence-record.v1.schema.json`; gate references now require allowlisted JSON record paths plus SHA-256. The checker verifies tracked regular non-symlink records, record schema/digest, phase/gate/level binding, source commit, source-commit artifact modes/digests, and supporting-review digests. |
| Unsafe checker narrowing and write order | Parsed input stays `unknown` until schema validation; schema/compile failures return stable diagnostics; projection writes occur only after all validation passes. |
| One-way gate and README drift checks | Gate headings must match registry entries bidirectionally and in order; both app and documentation projections are generated/checked. |
| Dependency-start loophole | Removed local execution status entirely. Dependency order remains acyclic planning data; activation/completion is accepted only through global authorities. |
| MP-P6 violated ranking/quality non-goals | Removed ranker, model-quality comparison, recommendations, quality corpus gates, and procurement ordering. MP-P6 is an observational evidence/operations/cost/remediation cockpit. |
| MP-P4 enforced authorization too early | MP-P4 now emits immutable asymmetric transition/revocation events only; MP-P5 exclusively consumes them and enforces profiles/traffic. |
| Phase 1 actor and approval gaps | Added per-field accountable actor, source, delegate, unknown/escalation/conflict states; added data, application, and procurement/contract owners; bound use-case-owner attestation, renewal, correction, and revocation to the passport digest. |
| Optional assistant became mandatory | Removed MP-P2 from the deterministic chain and MP-P7 dependency; managed service defines base and optional-assistance variants. |
| Monitoring action/accountability gaps | Added assignee, accountable role, due instant, escalation, approved disposition, closure evidence, ageing metrics, and versioned material-change reconciliation. |
| Managed-service commercial/privacy ambiguity | Replaced the broad guarantee with bounded commitments; added provider/key/cost modes, contractual RACI, DPA/controller/processor/subprocessor allocation, locations/transfers, audit rights, support severities, exclusions, escalation, and remedies. |
| Opaque approvals not auditable | Added customer-controlled IdP or signed role-at-time pseudonym mapping with access, retention, deletion, custody, and break-glass rules. |
| Unsafe language and missing glossary | Replaced “what can be used” and “compliance metrics”; added concise definitions for tunnel, passport, doctrine, deployment configuration, access profile, and qualified. |

## Follow-up review of `2f749ded`

The independent [business](FOLLOW-UP-BUSINESS-REVIEW.md), [technical](FOLLOW-UP-TECHNICAL-REVIEW.md), and [architecture](FOLLOW-UP-ARCHITECTURE-REVIEW.md) passes all rejected the first remediation commit. They confirmed the authority, capability-boundary, accountability, optional-assistance, and managed-service RACI corrections, then identified evidence false-greens and smaller sequencing/wording defects.

| Follow-up finding | Second remediation |
| --- | --- |
| Qualified and in-service levels were self-declared | Added exact tool versions, content-digested input identities, non-empty commands, harness requirements for verified-plus, favorable qualified verdicts, no unresolved blocking/major finding, and bounded operated-instance observations for `in_service`. |
| Required reviews were optional or reusable despite rejection | Each phase now declares required independent roles. Qualified records bind distinct non-producer reviewer references to content-addressed `review-attestation.v1` records. The checker verifies exact candidate/phase/gate/role/reviewer binding, favorable attestation verdict, zero blocking/major findings, and the human report digest. |
| Evidence hashing/parsing had a TOCTOU gap | Evidence records, review attestations, and reports are read as regular non-symlink Git-index blobs; each digest and JSON parse uses the same immutable byte buffer. Candidate artifacts and repository fixtures are read from exact source-commit blobs. |
| Evidence validation lacked adversarial coverage | Expanded the checker suite from 11 to 33 tests, including valid qualified/in-service paths and negatives for untracked/symlink records, record/fixture/operational digests, missing gate-definition binding, phase/gate/level/source-commit drift, empty reproducibility fields, missing/shared/self-review, rejecting attestations, and service observations. |
| README projection writes could partially drift | Both expected files are staged before replacement; applied replacements roll back on a later rename failure, with a test proving no projection changes when second-file staging fails. |
| MP-P4 exposed an orphan quality-monitoring path | Restricted refreshes to route operations and evidence-health observations; explicitly prohibited model-output quality measurement, model comparison, or preferred-route inference. |
| Managed-service pilot/production/commercial ordering was circular | Added a separately owner-authorized non-commercial pilot, then a qualified production-only cutover gate, then an in-service smoke/rollback/operational-window gate before separate paid-onboarding approval. |
| Metric authority, denial ownership, and “activity steering” were overstated | Limited `METRICS.md` claims to fields it owns, assigned runtime metric bindings to emitted records, made downstream authorization contracts own denial, and renamed the app summary to activity observation. |

## Counter-review of `a95c313`

The independent [business](COUNTER-REVIEW-A95C313-BUSINESS.md), [technical](COUNTER-REVIEW-A95C313-TECHNICAL.md), and [architecture](COUNTER-REVIEW-A95C313-ARCHITECTURE.md) counter-reviews approved the product/business surface but rejected the second remediation on one architecture boundary and several evidence-gate defects.

| Counter-review finding | Third remediation |
| --- | --- |
| MP-P3 selected and re-evaluated affected needs | MP-P3 now emits bounded immutable policy/exception lifecycle events only. MP-P4 is explicitly the sole consumer that selects and re-evaluates affected needs. |
| Gate criteria could drift after the evidence source commit | Every evidence record now binds the canonical gate-section SHA-256. The checker derives it from the exact source-commit phase-document blob and requires equality with the current regular Git-index blob; unstaged worktree text cannot substitute for either. |
| In-service windows could end after record creation and lacked deployment authorization | Service observations require `start < end <= recordedAt`, operated-environment identity matching the deployment, and a content-addressed tracked deployment-authorization artifact in addition to smoke, rollback, and incident evidence. |
| Evidence paths bypassed secret scanning | Removed the generic evidence-directory exclusion. The canonical Model Policy evidence subtree is checked for credential and personal-data markers; only known historical review reports and scanner fixtures keep narrow exclusions. |
| Ajv imports were indirect | Declared `ajv` and `ajv-formats` as direct app development dependencies through the workspace catalog. |
| Coverage was informative only | Added an app-local line/function threshold and a required CI step for the phase-checker coverage run. |
| Missing adversarial regressions | Added indexed semantic-drift, unstaged-worktree divergence, future-window, deployment-authorization, operated-environment, credential, and evidence-PII tests. |

## Re-review of `e03226f`

The independent [business](COUNTER-REVIEW-E03226F-BUSINESS.md), [technical](COUNTER-REVIEW-E03226F-TECHNICAL.md), and [architecture](COUNTER-REVIEW-E03226F-ARCHITECTURE.md) passes approved the business surface but rejected the third remediation for unauthorized integrator writes and three remaining evidence false-greens.

| Re-review finding | Fourth remediation |
| --- | --- |
| Shared CI, lockfile, and secret-scanner writes exceeded Model Policy write paths | Restored `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `bun.lock`, and `tools/quality/check-secret-scan*` to their pre-remediation blobs and withdrew the app dependency entries that would require an integrator lock update. Coverage and sensitive-evidence enforcement now live in app-owned checker/tests discovered by the unchanged root test gate. |
| Roadmap and schemas came from mutable worktree files | The checker first snapshots the Git index and reads the roadmap plus all four schemas from regular indexed blobs; digest/parse/validation use those bytes, and staged-invalid/unstaged-valid adversarial tests refuse substitution. |
| Operational evidence accepted unscanned arbitrary files | Operational evidence paths are JSON-only. The checker scans every referenced evidence, attestation, report, and operational blob for credential/personal-data markers before parsing, without changing shared scanner policy. |
| Operational artifacts were hash-only claims | Added `operational-evidence.v1.schema.json` with closed authorization/smoke/rollback/incident variants. The checker requires distinct paths/IDs, expected favorable outcomes, exact evidence/phase/gate/deployment/window binding, authorization before the window, observations inside it, coherent record times, and resolved incidents. |
| Coverage required a shared CI edit | Added a repository-discovered app test that executes the app-local line/function coverage threshold; the existing unchanged root `bun test` CI gate therefore blocks regression. |
| Operational false-greens lacked regressions | Added denying, empty, unrelated, reused, sensitive, future-window, environment mismatch, invalid-digest, and valid resolved-incident cases. |

## Intentionally not fabricated

- No work package, ADR/specification amendment, owner selection, wave activation, production approval, or commercial approval is marked accepted. Those are external human-controlled prerequisites.
- Existing candidate/lock wording in normative Policy Core authorities is not edited by this documentation change; any inconsistency there requires its own authorized authority change.
- No rejected review is reused as passed gate evidence. These reports document why the first candidate was rejected.

## Verification required for the remediated candidate

- app phase-plan checker and adversarial tests;
- app test suite;
- repository typecheck, Biome, source policy, contract checks, Bun suite, Markdown links, and diff hygiene;
- independent counter-review against the next immutable remediation commit before merge.
